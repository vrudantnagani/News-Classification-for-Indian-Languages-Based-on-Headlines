# News Classification for Indian Languages Based on Headlines

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying news headlines in three Indian languages: English, Hindi, and Gujarati. Utilizing machine learning and deep learning approaches, the aim is to classify news headlines into predefined categories: Business, Entertainment, Politics, Sports, and Technology. The dataset includes multilingual news headlines and demonstrates the effectiveness of various models in multilingual text classification.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of three subsets:
- **English Dataset**: 37,395 headlines.
- **Gujarati Dataset**: 37,500 headlines.
- **Hindi Dataset**: 37,779 headlines.

Each headline is categorized into one of the following classes:
- Business
- Entertainment
- Politics
- Sports
- Technology

Datasets are stored in the repository as:
- `english-train`
- `gujarati-train`
- `hindi-train`
